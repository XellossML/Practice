This repository is intended primarily to document my progress as I learn new things within programming and computer science
Will mostly contain various scripts or other code which may or may not be connected to one of my other projects
For now will contain purely Python code. May contain other languages such as SQL at a later date once proficiency within Python is gained. 
Feel free to comment or make suggestions as new files are added!
